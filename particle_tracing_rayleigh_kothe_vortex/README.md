## Contents
### `experiments/`
Contains subdirectories for each experiment. Each experiment comes with:
- A `generate.py` script that sets up the directory structure and generates the necessary configuration files for the experiment.
- A `clean.sh` script that removes all files generated by the experiment.
- A `run.py` script that runs the experiment.
- One or more `.ipynb`-notebooks that are used to post-process the results generated by the experiment and create plots.

### `experiments/util.py`
Contains utility functions to automate the process of running multiple instances (called runs) of the particle tracing with different parameters.
