# Replication Data for: Flexible mesh-particle coupling with preCICE
This dataset contains the software components and numerical examples from the bachelor's thesis *Flexible mesh-particle coupling with preCICE* by Robin Walloner.
In particular, this includes the modified versions of LIGGGHTS, preCICE, the OpenFOAM-preCICE adapter, as well as the OpenFOAM implementation of the Anderson and Jackson equations.
Instructions for building and running are provided in the `README.md` file within the respective archive.

## Contents

### Software components
- `LIGGGHTS`: the modified version of LIGGGHTS described in Section 3.4
- `preCICE`: the not-yet-released version of preCICE used for the CFD-DEM cases
- `OpenFOAM-adapter`: the modified version of the OpenFOAM-preCICE adapter used for the CFD-DEM cases
- `AndersonJacksonFoam`: the modified PIMPLE solver implementing the [Anderson and Jackson](https://doi.org/10.1021/i160024a007) equations described in Section 2.1

### Numerical examples
- `Particle_tracing_vortex_flow*`: the vortex flow scenario from Section 4.1
- `Particle_tracing_channel_flow*`: the channel flow scenario from Section 4.2
- `CFD-DEM_single_particle_sedimentation*`: the single particle sedimentation scenario from Section 4.3
- `CFD-DEM_fluidized_bed*`: the fluidized bed scenario from Section 4.4

All numerical examples are provided in two version: one `_setup` version that contains only the case definition and files necessary to run the simulations, and one `_with_results` version that additionally contains the (large) result files generated by the simulations.

## Reproducing results
To reproduce the results, follow the instructions in the `README.md` file found in the archive of the respective numerical example.
