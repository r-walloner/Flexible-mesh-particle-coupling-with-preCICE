# Flexible mesh-particle coupling with preCICE
This repository contains the code and other artifacts for my thesis on flexible mesh-particle coupling with preCICE.

## Contents
### `particle_tracing_rayleigh_kothe_vortex/`
The first one-way coupled prototype.

This prototype focuses on evaluating the mapping and tracking errors of our one-way coupled particle tracing scheme.
For this purpose, we use the Rayleigh-Kothe vortex function to generate a flow field that the particles trace.
Both participants are implemented using the deal.II library.

### `particle_tracing_channel_flow/`
The second one-way coupled prototype.

This prototype focuses on establishing a load balancing strategy for the particle participant.
The flow field is generated by an OpenFOAM simulation.
The particle participant is based on the one from the first prototype, but extended to support load balancing.

### `liggghts_adapter/`
The preCICE adapter for the LIGGGHTS particle simulation software.

### `other/`
Other artifacts that are not relevant for the thesis itself.
