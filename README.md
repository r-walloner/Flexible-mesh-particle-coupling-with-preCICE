# Replication Data for: Flexible mesh-particle coupling with preCICE
This dataset contains the software components and numerical examples from the bachelor's thesis *Flexible mesh-particle coupling with preCICE* by Robin Walloner.
In particular, this includes the modified versions of LIGGGHTS, preCICE, the OpenFOAM-preCICE adapter, as well as the OpenFOAM implementation of the Anderson and Jackson equations.
Instructions for building and running are provided in the `README.md` file within the respective archive.

## Contents

### Software components
- `LIGGGHTS`: Modified version of LIGGGHTS described in Section 3.4
- `preCICE`: Not-yet-released version of preCICE used for the CFD-DEM cases
- `OpenFOAM-adapter`: Modified version of the OpenFOAM-preCICE adapter used for the CFD-DEM cases
- `AndersonJacksonFoam`: Modified PIMPLE solver implementing the [Anderson and Jackson](https://doi.org/10.1021/i160024a007) equations described in Section 2.1

### Numerical examples
The CFD-DEM examples are split into multiple archives: one for the case setup and one (or more) for the results.
The setup archive contains only the case definition and files necessary to run the simulations.
The results archive(s) contain the large output files generated by the simulations.

- `Particle_tracing_vortex_flow`: Setup and results for the vortex flow scenario from Section 4.1
- `Particle_tracing_channel_flow`: Setup and results for the channel flow scenario from Section 4.2
- `CFD-DEM_single_particle_sedimentation`: Setup for the single particle sedimentation scenario from Section 4.3
- `CFD-DEM_single_particle_sedimentation_results`: Results of the single particle sedimentation scenario from Section 4.3
- `CFD-DEM_fluidized_bed`: Setup for the fluidized bed scenario from Section 4.4
- `CFD-DEM_fluidized_bed_results_gidaspow`: Results of the fluidized bed scenario from Section 4.4 using the Gidaspow drag model
- `CFD-DEM_fluidized_bed_results_koch_hill`: Results of the fluidized bed scenario from Section 4.4 using the Koch and Hill drag model
- `CFD-DEM_fluidized_bed_profiling_results`: Profiling results of the fluidized bed scenario from Section 4.4

## Reproducing results
To reproduce the results, follow the instructions in the `README.md` file found in the setup archive of the respective numerical example.
